    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a Chinese national scientific research facility operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20 deg2 in the sky. Until July 2019, LAMOST has completed its pilot survey, which was launched in October 2011 and ended in June 2012, and the regular survey of the first seven years, which was initiated on September 2012[1-7]. In this data release, there are totally 10,431,197 low resolution spectra published, which satisfy the selection criteria that the LAMOST LRS General Catalog also used. The data products of this release can be available from the website http://dr7.lamost.org/v2.0/.\r\n\r\nGuoshoujing Telescope (the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope LAMOST) is a National Major Scientific Project built by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Funding for the project has been provided by the National Development and Reform Commission. LAMOST is operated and managed by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",

The data products of this release can be available from the website http://dr7.lamost.org/v2.0/, and they include：\r\n\r\n1.    Spectra. - There are 10,431,197 flux (relatively)- and wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted spectra in DR7, including 9,846,793 stellar spectra, 198,272 galaxy spectra, 66,612 quasar spectra, and 319,520 unknown object spectra, and these spectra cover the wavelength range of 3690 Å - 9100 Å with a resolution of 1800[2-3] at the 5500 Å.\r\n\r\n2.    Spectroscopic Parameter Catalogs. - In this data release, nine spectroscopic parameter catalogs are also published，and they are the LAMOST LRS General Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Stellar Parameter Catalog of A, F, G and K Stars, the LAMOST LRS Line-Index Catalog of A Type Stars, the LAMOST LRS Catalog of gM, dM, and sdM Stars, the LAMOST LRS Multiple Epoch Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Observed Plate Information Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Input Catalog, the LAMOST LRS Catalog of Cataclysmic Variable Stars, and the LAMOST LRS Catalog of  White Dwarf Stars respectively. Tens of parameters are included in these catalogs, such as right ascension, declination, signal to noise ratio (S/N), magnitude, gaia_source_id, gaia_g_mean_mag, atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity), radial velocity, element abundance, spectral line indices, line widths, the metallicity sensitive parameter, and the magnetic activity flag.",
